Output Node
===========

Output nodes are mostly used to affect the behaviour of an AgentInstance. Usually, the output node is associated with an
output channel.

Output nodes represent the final output of the agent's brain, determining its behavior. These nodes are often the result
of a complex series of fuzzy logic processes within the brain, but they can also be as simple as a single output node
with a manually entered value.
